RP1 (IO of RPI5): https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp1/rp1-peripherals.pdf

Best way to run the clock for radio TX would be either the CORE or AUDIO clocks.
Described in Chapter 2.5, we have the AUDIO_OUT clock whuch runs at 153.6 MHz, which is the closest to 500, however as the original fm_transmitter, we can use the system clocks to run our signals.

In 2.5.2, we have this paragraph: "The Core clock (clk_sys) typically runs at 200MHz. The Core PLL VCO is kept at 2GHz so other fixed frequencies can be
generated from this source"

Actually, the best may be the Audio clocks, as they're unused

UPDATE: Read on https://github.com/fandahao17/Raspberry-Pi-DMA-Tutorial

bcm_host_get_peripheral_address is completly unuseable here (see https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/issues/3350)

First, i'm gonna focus on the original pifm.c instead of this.

RPI 5 has these return values:
bcm_host_get_peripheral_address -> 0x00000010
bcm_host_get_peripheral_size -> 0x7c000000
bcm_host_get_sdram_address -> 0xc0000000

RPI 4 is similieary wrong values, are they the same?
